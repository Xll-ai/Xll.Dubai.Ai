# Shenzhen Access Playbook: AI Hardware Pipeline from China to Dubai

## 1 · Choose Your Entry Point in Shenzhen

| Zone | Why It Matters | Incentives You Can Bank |
|------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone** | Built for cross-border finance + tech; full foreign ownership allowed | 15% CIT on qualified tech profits, HK-aligned expat income tax |
| **Huaqiangbei & Futian CBD** | World’s densest component market, fast respins | No tax breaks, but retail-level availability, same-day prototyping |
| **Shekou Free Trade Port** | Nightly containers to Jebel Ali, bonded warehousing | Inventory held duty-free until re-export |

> 💡 **Tip**: Set up a consulting WFOE in Qianhai if you don’t need a manufacturing license. Takes ~4 weeks if shareholder docs are apostilled.

## 2 · Sourcing & Prototyping Pipeline

- **Component Scouting**: Start at Huaqiangbei for <5k unit lots → graduate to WenTai, Comtech.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Use PCBWay, Seeed Studio, Huaqin Bridge (2-day turns if 100% domestic BOM).
- **Pre-Compliance Testing**: TÜV Süd / SGS campuses co-located with fabs. Align early.

## 3 · Logistics Corridor to Dubai

| Mode | Door-to-Door Time* | When to Use | Notes |
|------|---------------------|-------------|-------|
| **Air (SZX → DXB)** | 3–7 days | Samples, <300kg | Add 24h for UAE import scan |
| **Sea FCL (Shekou → Jebel Ali)** | ~18 days (FCL), 27–33 days (LCL) | Pallet volumes | Bonded delivery to free zone |
| **Rail + Sea (Yiwu → Jebel Ali)** | 22–25 days | Port congestion backup | Slightly costlier, but faster |

> 💸 **Cost Thumb-Rule**: 20’ container (Shekou → Jebel Ali) = $1,300–1,600 (Jan–Mar 2025 spot)

## 4 · Customs, Tax & Cash Flow

| Jurisdiction | Tax Hit | How to Minimise |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| **China Export** | 13% VAT refundable | Use Shenzhen exporter of record (1% fee) |
| **UAE Import** | 5% duty or 0% in free zones | Route through JAFZA / DAFZA + Designated Free Zone VAT scheme |

> 🔮 **Future Upside**: GCC-China FTA may cut ICT tariffs retroactively. Track HS-codes now for rebates.

## 5 · Export-Control & Compliance Checklist

| Item | Regulator | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Nvidia A100/H100/H200, AMD MI300** | US BIS | File BIS-748P + audit clause |
| **Chinese GaN/GaAs** | PRC MOFCOM | Ensure supplier holds quota |
| **Dual-use AI (e.g. facial, gait)** | UAE DIFC, Digital Dubai | Use DIFC AIA to show civil end-use |

> ⚠️ **Real-World Precedent**: G42 unwound Huawei ties before Microsoft AI deal due to compliance optics.

## 6 · Collaboration Models That Work

| Structure | When to Pick It | Key Paperwork |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Pure Procurement** | Need UAE origin label | Quality agreement + BOM SLA |
| **Joint R&D w/ ODM** | Want validated RF stack + faster FCC | NNN agreement (EN + Mandarin) |
| **Satellite Lab (HAX, TroubleMaker)** | Early-stage prototyping | Accelerator term-sheet (3–8% equity) |
